# Password Generator

## Description

People with access to sensitive data require strong passwords. This application will randomly generate a password that meets the user's chosen criteria.

- When the Generate Password button is clicked, a series of prompts for password criteria appears.
- When the criteria is chosen, the length of the password must be selected, no fewer than 8 characters and no greater than 128 characters.
- When given the choice of which types of characters to include, user can choose for their password to include or not include lowercase, uppercase, and/or special characters.
- When each prompt is answered, the input will be validated and at least one character type selected.
- When all the prompts are answered, the password is generated and displayed either in an alert or written onto the page.
- The application will produce no errors in the Chrome DevTools console.
