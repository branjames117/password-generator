# Password Generator

## Description

People with access to sensitive data require strong passwords. This application will randomly generate a password that meets the user's chosen criteria.

- When the Generate Password button is clicked, user input is validated: is the length between 8 and 128 characters? is at least one of the character types (besides spaces) selected?
- If user input is invalid, the input border becomes red and an error message is displayed, and no password is generated.
- If user input is valid, a password matching the chosen criteria is randomly generated, and the Copy Password to Clipboard button is enabled.
- When the Copy Password to Clipboard button is clicked, the generated password is copied to the clipboard.
